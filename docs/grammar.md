# Jaiph Grammar

Jaiph source files (`.jh`) combine a small orchestration language with shell execution. **Workflows** and **rules** express Jaiph steps — sequencing, conditionals, prompts, channels. **Scripts** contain Bash (or another interpreter via shebang) and run as isolated subprocesses. The runtime interprets the AST directly; only script bodies are emitted as executable files. This page is the language reference. For system boundaries and event contracts, see [Architecture](architecture).

**Scope:** Lexical rules, syntax, and runtime semantics for normal modules (`.jh`). Test files (`*.test.jh`) are described in [Testing](testing.md). CLI and configuration are covered in [CLI](cli.md) and [Configuration](configuration.md).

**Source of truth:** When this document and the compiler disagree, treat the implementation as authoritative.

## Language Concepts

Jaiph enforces a strict boundary between orchestration and execution. Workflows and rules contain only Jaiph steps. Bash lives in `script` bodies.

- **Workflows** — Named sequences of Jaiph steps: `ensure`, `run`, `prompt`, `const`, `fail`, `return`, `log`/`logerr`, inbox `send` (`channel <- …`) and `route` (`channel -> workflow`), brace `if`, and `run async`. Any line that is not a recognized step is a parse error — extract bash to a `script` and call it with `run`.

- **Rules** — Named blocks of structured Jaiph steps: `ensure` (other rules), `run` (scripts only — not workflows), `const`, brace `if`, `fail`, `log`/`logerr`, `return "…"`. Rules cannot use `prompt`, inbox send/route, `wait`, `run async`, or `ensure … recover`.

- **Scripts** — Top-level `script` blocks emitted as separate executable files under the workspace `scripts/` directory. Called from workflows or rules with `run`. Bodies are opaque to the compiler — the parser does not check Jaiph keywords inside them. Use `echo`/`printf` for data output and `return N`/`return $?` for exit status. Polyglot support: a `#!` shebang as the first line selects the interpreter; otherwise `#!/usr/bin/env bash` is used.

- **Channels** — Named message queues declared with `channel name`. Workflows send messages with `<-` and register route handlers with `->`. See [Inbox & Dispatch](inbox.md).

- **Config** — Optional block setting agent and run options. Allowed at module level and inside individual workflow bodies. See [Configuration](configuration.md).

## Imports and Exports

`import "path" as alias` loads another module. `export rule` / `export workflow` marks a declaration as public. In practice, any rule or workflow in an imported module can be referenced — export is not enforced at reference time.

```jaiph
import "tools/security.jh" as security
import "bootstrap.jh" as bootstrap

export workflow default {
  ensure security.scan_passes()
  run bootstrap.nodejs()
}
```

Imported symbols use **dot notation**: `alias.name`. A reference is either a bare `IDENT` (local) or `IDENT.IDENT` (module-qualified). The compiler validates that the target exists and matches the calling keyword (`ensure` for rules, `run` for workflows/scripts).

## Module-Level Declarations

### Top-Level `const`

`const name = value` declares a module-scoped variable. Values can be double-quoted strings (including multiline), single-quoted strings, or bare tokens like numbers.

```jaiph
const REPO = "my-project"
const MAX_RETRIES = 3
const GREETING = "Hello,
world"
```

Variables are accessible as `${name}` inside that module's rules and workflows. They are **not** passed to script subprocesses — use arguments or shared libraries instead. Declaration order matters: `${name}` in a value only expands variables already bound above. Names share the unified namespace with channels, rules, workflows, and scripts.

Top-level `local` is rejected — use `const`.

### Channel Declarations

```jaiph
channel alerts
channel reports
```

One channel per line. Channels are used with `send` (`<-`) and `route` (`->`) inside workflows.

## Definitions

All three definition forms — `rule`, `workflow`, `script` — require braces on the declaration line. Definitions must **not** use parentheses (parentheses are reserved for call sites).

```jaiph
rule check_status { … }        # correct
workflow default { … }          # correct
script setup { … }              # correct
# workflow default() { … }      — E_PARSE: definitions must not use parentheses
```

## Call Arguments and Positional Parameters

Call sites pass arguments in parentheses with comma-separated expressions:

```jaiph
run show_args("my-task", "my-role")
ensure check_branch("${arg1}")
```

There is no declaration-time parameter list, no default values, and no compile-time arity checking. The runtime exposes arguments as `${arg1}`, `${arg2}`, … in orchestration strings (rules and workflows) and `$1`, `$2`, … in script bodies.

## Workflow Steps

### `run` — Execute a Workflow or Script

In a **workflow**, `run` targets a workflow or script. In a **rule**, `run` targets a script only.

```jaiph
run setup_env()
run lib.build_project("${arg1}")
result = run helper("${arg}")
const output = run transform()
```

Shell redirection or pipelines after `run` (`>`, `|`, `&`) are rejected — use a script for shell I/O.

**Capture:** For a workflow callee, capture gets the explicit `return "…"` value. For a script callee, capture gets stdout.

### `run async` — Concurrent Execution

`run async ref(args)` starts a workflow or script concurrently. All pending async steps are implicitly joined before the enclosing workflow returns. If any fail, the workflow fails with an aggregated error.

```jaiph
workflow default {
  run async lib.task_a()
  run async lib.task_b()
  # both joined automatically before workflow returns
}
```

Constraints:
- Workflow-only — rejected in rules with `E_VALIDATE`.
- Capture is not supported: `name = run async …` is `E_PARSE`.
- For concurrent bash (pipelines, `&`), put the bash in a script and call with `run`.

### `ensure` — Execute a Rule

`ensure` runs a rule and succeeds if its exit code is 0.

```jaiph
ensure check_deps()
result = ensure lib.validate("${input}")
```

### `ensure … recover` — Retry with Recovery

When `ensure` includes a `recover` block, failure triggers a retry loop: run the rule, on failure run the recovery body, repeat until the rule passes or the maximum attempt rounds are reached (default 3, overridable with `JAIPH_ENSURE_MAX_RETRIES`).

```jaiph
# Single-statement recovery
ensure install_deps() recover run fix_deps()

# Block recovery
ensure ci_passes("${repo}") recover {
  log "CI failed, attempting fix"
  run auto_fix()
}
```

The recovery body receives `${arg1}` as the merged stdout+stderr from the failed rule execution. Each retry gets fresh output from the current attempt.

Syntax rules:
- All rule arguments must appear inside the call parentheses **before** `recover`.
- `recover` must be followed by at least one recovery step (bare `recover` at end of line is `E_PARSE`).
- `ensure … recover` is workflow-only — not allowed in rule bodies.

### `prompt` — Agent Interaction

Sends a double-quoted string to the configured agent backend.

```jaiph
prompt "Review the following code for security issues"
answer = prompt "Summarize the report"
```

**Typed prompt (returns schema):** Ask the agent for structured JSON output:

```jaiph
result = prompt "Analyze this code" \
  returns '{ type: string, risk: string }'
```

When `returns` is present, capture is required. The schema is flat only — allowed types are `string`, `number`, `boolean`. The runtime validates the response: it searches for valid JSON (last non-empty line, fenced code blocks, standalone `{…}`, embedded JSON). On success, the capture variable holds the raw JSON string and each field is exported as `${result_type}`, `${result_risk}`, etc. On failure, the step fails with a parse, missing-field, or type error.

Prompts are not allowed in rules.

### `const` — Variable Binding

`const name = <rhs>` introduces a variable in the workflow or rule body.

```jaiph
const tag = "v1.0"
const result = run helper("${arg}")
const check = ensure validator("${input}")
const answer = prompt "Summarize the report"
```

RHS forms: value expressions (`${var}`, quoted strings), or explicit `run`/`ensure`/`prompt` capture. A bare reference like `const x = ref(args)` is rejected — use `const x = run ref(args)`.

Restrictions on const RHS: `$(…)`, `${var:-fallback}`, `${var%%…}`, `${var//…}`, and `${#var}` are all rejected.

### `if` / `else if` / `else` — Conditionals

Only brace form with `ensure` or `run` conditions:

```jaiph
if ensure lib.check_input() {
  run process()
} else if not run file_exists("${path}") {
  fail "missing file"
} else {
  log "skipping"
}
```

`not` negates the condition. Branches contain normal workflow steps. Shell-style `if … then … fi` is not supported.

### `send` — Channel Messages

```jaiph
alerts <- "Build started"
reports <- ${output}
results <- run build_message("${data}")
inbox <-                                    # forward: sends ${arg1}
```

RHS must be empty (forward), a double-quoted literal, `${var}`, or `run ref(args)`. Arbitrary shell on the RHS is `E_PARSE`. Combining capture and send (`name = channel <- …`) is `E_PARSE`.

### `route` — Channel Routing

```jaiph
alerts -> handle_alert
events -> handler_a, handler_b
```

Registers a static routing rule. When a message arrives on the channel, the runtime calls each target workflow with `${arg1}=message`, `${arg2}=channel`, `${arg3}=sender`. Multiple targets dispatch sequentially. Routes are stored in `WorkflowDef.routes`, not in steps. See [Inbox & Dispatch](inbox.md).

### `log` and `logerr`

```jaiph
log "Processing ${arg1}"
logerr "Warning: ${name} not found"
```

`log` writes to stdout; `logerr` writes to stderr (shown with a red `!` marker in the progress tree). Both support `${identifier}` interpolation and inline captures. At runtime, backslash escapes in the final string are interpreted (`\n` → newline).

### `fail`

```jaiph
fail "Missing required configuration"
```

Aborts the workflow or rule with a message on stderr and non-zero exit.

### `return`

```jaiph
return "success"
return "${result}"
```

Sets the managed return value in rules and workflows. A bare integer (`return 0`) or `return $?` is a bash exit code, not a Jaiph value return. `return "…"` is not allowed in script bodies — use `echo`/`printf`.

### `wait`

```jaiph
wait
```

Legacy no-op kept for backwards compatibility. Use `run async` for managed parallel work.

### Assignment Capture

`name = <step>` captures a value without `const`:

```jaiph
result = run helper("${arg}")
check = ensure validator("${input}")
answer = prompt "Summarize the report"
```

Prefer `const name = …` for new code.

## Scripts

### Bash Scripts

```jaiph
script setup_env {
  export BASE_DIR=$(pwd)
  mkdir -p "$BASE_DIR/output"
  echo "Environment initialized"
}
```

Script bodies are opaque bash — the compiler does not parse them as Jaiph steps. For bash scripts, the emitter applies only lightweight transforms: `return` normalization, `local`/`export`/`readonly` spacing, and import alias resolution.

### Polyglot Scripts

Add a shebang as the first line to use another interpreter:

```jaiph
script analyze {
  #!/usr/bin/env python3
  import sys
  print(f"Analyzing {sys.argv[1]}")
}

script transform {
  #!/usr/bin/env node
  const data = process.argv[2];
  console.log(JSON.stringify({ result: data }));
}
```

Non-bash scripts skip Jaiph keyword validation and emit the body verbatim.

### Script Isolation

Scripts run in a clean process environment (`env -i`). Only these variables are inherited:

- System: `PATH`, `HOME`, `TERM`, `USER`
- Jaiph: `JAIPH_LIB`, `JAIPH_SCRIPTS`, `JAIPH_WORKSPACE`
- Positional arguments (`$1`, `$2`, …)

Module-scoped `const` variables are **not** visible. Use shared libraries (`source "$JAIPH_LIB/…"`) or pass data as arguments.

## String Interpolation {#string-interpolation}

Jaiph orchestration strings support `${identifier}` interpolation:

| Form | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `${varName}` | Primary | All Jaiph strings |
| `${arg1}`, `${arg2}`, … | Positional arguments | All Jaiph strings |
| `${run ref(args)}` | Inline capture — executes call, inlines output | All Jaiph strings |
| `${ensure ref(args)}` | Inline capture — executes rule, inlines result | All Jaiph strings |
| `$varName` | Rejected — use `${varName}` | — |
| `$1`, `$2` | Not supported — use `${arg1}`, `${arg2}` | `script` bodies only |
| `${var:-fallback}` | Rejected (`E_PARSE`) | — |
| `$(…)` | Rejected (`E_PARSE`) | — |
| `` ` `` (unescaped backtick) | Rejected (`E_PARSE`) — escape with `` \` `` | — |

**Inline captures** execute a managed call directly inside the string:

```jaiph
log "Got: ${run some_script()}"
log "Status: ${ensure check_ok()}"
prompt "Fix the issue: ${ensure get_diagnostics()}"
return "${run some_script()}"
```

If any inline capture fails, the enclosing step fails immediately. Nested inline captures (`${run foo(${run bar()})}`) are rejected — extract the inner call to a `const`.

## Step Output Contract

Every step produces three distinct outputs — status, value, and logs:

| Step kind | Status source | Value channel (for `x = …`) | Log channel |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ensure rule` | rule exit code | explicit `return` value | rule body logs to artifacts |
| `run workflow` | workflow exit code | explicit `return` value | workflow step logs to artifacts |
| `run script` | script exit code | **stdout** of script body | script stdout/stderr to artifacts |
| `prompt` | prompt exit code | final assistant answer | transcript to artifacts |
| `log` / `logerr` | always 0 | empty | event + stdout/stderr |
| `fail` | non-zero (abort) | empty | message to stderr |
| `run async` | aggregated | not supported (capture rejected) | async step logs to artifacts |
| `wait` | no-op | empty | n/a |
| `const` | same as RHS step | empty (binds local) | n/a |

Key rules:
- For `ensure`/`run` to a rule or workflow, assignment captures only the callee's explicit `return "…"`.
- For `run` to a script, assignment captures **stdout**. Use `echo`/`printf` to pass data back.
- `return "value"` / `return "${var}"` are valid in rules and workflows only, not in scripts.

## Lexical Notes

- **Identifiers:** `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`
- **References:** `IDENT` or `IDENT.IDENT` (module-qualified)
- **Comments:** Full-line `#` comments. Empty lines are ignored.
- **Shebang:** A `#!` first line of the file is ignored by the parser.
- **Import path:** Quoted string in `import "path" as alias`. Missing `.jh` extension is appended automatically.

## EBNF (Practical Form)

Informal symbols: `string` = quoted string; `call_ref` = `REF "(" [args] ")"` with comma-separated arguments; `quoted_or_multiline_string` = double-quoted string supporting `\$`, `\"`, `\\`, `` \` `` escapes, line continuation with trailing `\`, and `${identifier}` / `${run …}` / `${ensure …}` interpolation.

## Validation Rules

After parsing, the compiler validates references and config (`src/transpile/validate.ts`). Error codes:

- **E_PARSE:** Invalid syntax — duplicate config, invalid keys/values, unescaped backticks, `$(…)` or `${var:-fallback}` in orchestration strings, `prompt … returns` without capture, bare `ref(args)` in const RHS (use `run`/`ensure`/`prompt`), `local` at top level, unrecognized workflow/rule line, invalid send RHS, arguments after `recover`, bare `recover` with no recovery step, nested inline captures, shell redirection after `run`/`ensure`, parentheses on definitions, or missing `{` on definition line.
- **E_SCHEMA:** Invalid `returns` schema — empty, non-flat, unsupported type (only `string`, `number`, `boolean`).
- **E_VALIDATE:** Reference errors — unknown rule/workflow, duplicate alias, `ensure` on non-rule, `run` on rule, `run` to workflow inside rule, `run async` in rule, forbidden Jaiph usage inside `$(…)`.
- **E_IMPORT_NOT_FOUND:** Import target file does not exist.

Validation rules:

1. At most one `config` block per file and per workflow. Workflow config must appear before steps. Only `agent.*` and `run.*` keys in workflow config.
2. Config values must match expected types. `agent.backend` must be `"cursor"` or `"claude"`.
3. Import aliases must be unique (`E_VALIDATE`). Import targets must exist (`E_IMPORT_NOT_FOUND`).
4. **Unified namespace:** channels, rules, workflows, scripts, and top-level `const` share one namespace per module.
5. `ensure` must target a rule. `run` in a workflow targets a workflow or script. `run` in a rule targets a script only.
6. Channel references in `send`/`route` must resolve to declared channels. Route targets must be workflows.
7. `ensure … recover` argument ordering: all arguments inside parentheses before `recover`.
8. Shell redirection (`>`, `|`, `&`) after `run`/`ensure` is rejected — use a script.

## Build Artifacts {#build-artifacts}

`jaiph run` and `jaiph test` do **not** transpile workflows to shell. The CLI calls `buildScripts()`, which emits only per-`script` executable files under `scripts/`. Workflows, rules, prompts, channels, and control flow are interpreted by `NodeWorkflowRuntime` from the AST.

Each `script name { … }` becomes `scripts/<name>` with `chmod +x`: shebang (custom or default `#!/usr/bin/env bash`) plus the body. At runtime, script steps run these files with a minimal environment.

## Runtime Execution

At runtime, the Node workflow runtime interprets the AST directly:

- **Config:** Precedence chain: environment → workflow-level → module-level → defaults.
- **Script isolation:** Managed subprocesses with only essential variables. Module-scoped variables not visible.
- **Prompt + schema:** JSON extraction and schema validation via the JS kernel. Exit codes: 0=ok, 1=parse error, 2=missing field, 3=type mismatch.
- **ensure … recover:** Bounded retry loop (default 3 rounds, `JAIPH_ENSURE_MAX_RETRIES`). Recovery body's `${arg1}` gets fresh merged stdout+stderr per attempt.
- **Assignment capture:** Rules and workflows use explicit `return "…"`. Scripts use stdout.
- **`run async`:** Promise-based concurrency. Implicit join via `Promise.allSettled` before workflow returns. Failures aggregated.
- **Channels:** Messages enqueued via `send`, dispatched to route targets at workflow end. Each target receives `${arg1}=message`, `${arg2}=channel`, `${arg3}=sender`.
