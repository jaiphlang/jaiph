# Jaiph CLI Reference

Jaiph ships as a command-line tool. You point it at `.jh` source files, and it validates, compiles script bodies, launches the workflow runtime, streams progress, and writes run artifacts under `.jaiph/runs`. This page covers all CLI commands, flags, and environment variables. For language syntax and step semantics, see [Grammar](grammar.md).

Before execution, the CLI runs compile-time validation and script extraction. It then hands off to the Node workflow runtime, which interprets the parsed AST directly — there is no Bash transpilation of workflows; only extracted `script` bodies are emitted as shell. The CLI owns process spawn and signal propagation; the runtime kernel owns prompt and script execution, file-backed inbox, the `__JAIPH_EVENT__` stream on stderr, and `run_summary.jsonl`. For full architecture details, see [Architecture](architecture).

**Commands:** `run`, `test`, `format`, `init`, `use`, `report`.

**Global options:** `-h` / `--help` and `-v` / `--version` are recognized only as the **first argument** (e.g. `jaiph --help`). They are not parsed after a subcommand or file path. `jaiph report` has its own `--help`.

## File shorthand

If the first argument is an existing file, Jaiph routes it automatically based on the extension. Files ending in **`*.test.jh`** are run as tests (same as `jaiph test <file>`). Other files ending in **`*.jh`** are run as workflows (same as `jaiph run <file>`). The `*.test.jh` check happens first, so test files are never mistaken for workflows.

```bash
# Workflow shorthand
jaiph ./flows/review.jh "review this diff"
# equivalent to: jaiph run ./flows/review.jh "review this diff"

# Test shorthand
jaiph ./e2e/say_hello.test.jh
# equivalent to: jaiph test ./e2e/say_hello.test.jh
```

## `jaiph run`

Parse, validate, and run a Jaiph workflow file. Requires a `workflow default` entrypoint.

```bash
jaiph run [--target <dir>] <file.jh> [--] [args...]
```

Any path ending in `.jh` is accepted (including `*.test.jh`, since the extension is still `.jh`). For files that only contain test blocks, use `jaiph test` instead.

**Flags:**

- **`--target <dir>`** — keep emitted script files and run metadata under `<dir>` instead of a temp directory (useful for debugging).
- **`--`** — end of Jaiph flags; remaining args are passed to `workflow default` (e.g. `jaiph run file.jh -- --verbose`).

**Examples:**

```bash
jaiph run ./.jaiph/bootstrap.jh
jaiph run ./flows/review.jh "review this diff"
```

### Argument passing

Positional arguments are available inside `script` bodies as standard bash `$1`, `$2`, `"$@"`. In Jaiph orchestration strings (`log`, `prompt`, `fail`, `return`, `send`, `run`/`ensure` args), use `${arg1}`, `${arg2}`, and `${name}` — only `${identifier}` forms are supported (no shell parameter expansion). The same rule applies to `prompt` text and to `const` RHS strings where orchestration applies.

Rules receive forwarded arguments through `ensure`:

```jaiph
script check_branch {
  test "$(git branch --show-current)" = "$1"
}

rule current_branch {
  run check_branch("${arg1}")
}

workflow default {
  ensure current_branch("main")
}
```

Workflow and rule bodies contain structured Jaiph steps only — use `run` to call a `script` for shell execution. In bash-bearing contexts (mainly `script` bodies, and restricted `const` / send RHS forms), `$(...)` and the first command word are validated: they must not invoke Jaiph rules, workflows, or scripts, contain inbox send (`<-`), or use `run` / `ensure` as shell commands (`E_VALIDATE`). See [Grammar — Managed calls vs command substitution](grammar.md#managed-calls-vs-command-substitution).

For `const` in those bodies, a reference plus arguments on the RHS must be written as `const name = run ref([args...])` (or `ensure` for rule capture), not as `const name = ref([args...])` — the latter is `E_PARSE` with text that explains the fix.

### Shebang execution

If a `.jh` file is executable and has `#!/usr/bin/env jaiph`, you can run it directly:

```bash
./.jaiph/bootstrap.jh "task details"
./flows/review.jh "review this diff"
```

### Compile-time and process model

The CLI runs `buildScripts()`, which walks the entry file and its import closure. Each reachable module is parsed and `validateReferences` runs before script files are written. Unrelated `.jh` files on disk are not read.

After validation, the CLI spawns the Node workflow runner as a detached child. The runner loads the graph with `buildRuntimeGraph()` (parse-only imports; no `validateReferences` here) and executes `NodeWorkflowRuntime`. Prompt steps, script subprocesses, inbox dispatch, and event emission are handled in the runtime kernel — workflows and rules are interpreted in-process; only `script` steps spawn a managed shell. The CLI listens on stderr for `__JAIPH_EVENT__` JSON lines, the single event channel for all execution modes. Stdout carries only plain script output, forwarded to the terminal as-is.

### Run progress and tree output

During `jaiph run`, the CLI renders a live tree of steps. Each step appears as a line with a marker, the step kind (`workflow`, `prompt`, `script`, `rule`), and the step name:

- **`▸`** — step started
- **`✓`** / **`✗`** — step completed (pass/fail), with elapsed time (e.g. `✓ workflow scanner (0s)`, `✗ rule ci_passes (11s)`)
- **`ℹ`** — `log` message (dim/gray, inline at the correct depth; no marker, spinner, or timing)
- **`!`** — `logerr` message (red, writes to stderr)

The root PASS/FAIL summary uses the format `✓ PASS workflow default (0.2s)`. Completion lines include the step kind and name so each line is self-identifying even when multiple steps run concurrently.

**`log` / `logerr` and backslash escapes:** The displayed text follows `echo -e` semantics — a literal `\n` or `\t` in the message becomes a newline or tab. `LOG` / `LOGERR` JSON on stderr (and the `message` field in `run_summary.jsonl`) carries the unexpanded shell string.

**TTY mode:** one extra line at the bottom shows the running workflow and elapsed time: `▸ RUNNING workflow <name> (X.Xs)` — updated in place every second. When the run completes, it is replaced by the final PASS/FAIL line.

**Non-TTY mode** (CI, pipes, log capture): no RUNNING line and no in-place updates. Step start (▸) and completion (✓/✗) lines still print as they occur. Long-running steps additionally print **heartbeat** lines to avoid looking like a hang:

- Format: `· <kind> <name> (running <N>s)` — entire line dim/gray (plain text with `NO_COLOR`).
- Cadence: first heartbeat after `JAIPH_NON_TTY_HEARTBEAT_FIRST_SEC` seconds (default **60**), then every `JAIPH_NON_TTY_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` milliseconds (default **30000**; minimum **250**). Short steps emit no heartbeats.
- Nested steps: heartbeats describe the innermost (deepest active) step.

**Event stream:** on stderr, the runtime emits `__JAIPH_EVENT__` lines (JSON). The CLI parses them to drive the tree, hooks, and failure summaries. Other stderr text is forwarded to the terminal. If a payload is not valid JSON, the CLI treats it as plain stderr.

**Parameterized invocations** show argument values inline in gray after the step name:

- All parameters use `key="value"` format in parentheses. Internal refs (`::impl`) and empty values are omitted.
- Positional parameters display as `1="value"`, `2="value"`. Named parameters display as `name="value"`.
- Whitespace in values is collapsed to a single space. Values are truncated to 32 characters (with `...`).
- Prompt steps show the backend name and a preview (first 24 characters of prompt text) in quotes: `prompt cursor "summarize the..."`, followed by parameters (capped at 96 characters total).

Example lines:

- `▸ workflow docs_page (1="docs/cli.md", 2="strict")`
- `· prompt cursor (running 60s)`
- `·   ▸ prompt cursor "${role} does ${task}" (role="engineer", task="Fix bugs")`
- `·   ▸ script fib (1="3")`
- `·   ▸ rule check_arg (1="Alice")`

If no parameters are passed, the line is unchanged (e.g. `▸ workflow default`). Disable color with `NO_COLOR=1`.

**Async sibling depth.** When a workflow contains multiple `run async` steps, all async branches render as siblings at the same indentation level. Inner steps within each branch appear one level deeper. The runtime isolates each async branch's frame stack, so `depth` on events is relative to the branch's own call depth.

**Prompt transcript replay.** The progress renderer shows only ▸ / ✓ lines for a `prompt` step — not a nested subtree. After the step completes (on terminal stdout, non-test runs), the runtime replays the step's `.out` artifact if stdout was not already streamed live. Replay is skipped when stdout is a pipe or when the prompt already streamed via tee. `jaiph test` does not use this replay path.

To surface the agent answer inline in the tree, use `log` explicitly:

```jaiph
response = prompt "Summarize the report"
log "${response}"
```

### Failed run summary (stderr)

On non-zero exit, the CLI may print a footer with the path to `run_summary.jsonl`, `out:` / `err:` artifact paths, and `Output of failed step:` plus a trimmed excerpt. These are resolved from the **first** `STEP_END` object in the summary with `status` != 0, using `out_content` / `err_content` when present and otherwise the `out_file` / `err_file` fields. If no failed `STEP_END` is found, the CLI falls back to a run-directory artifact heuristic.

### Run artifacts and live output

Each run directory is `<JAIPH_RUNS_DIR>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<HH-MM-SS>-<source>/`, where date and time are UTC and `<source>` is `JAIPH_SOURCE_FILE` if set, otherwise the entry file basename. Every step writes stdout and stderr to artifact files named with a zero-padded sequence prefix: `000001-module__rule.out`, `000002-module__workflow.err`, etc.

All step kinds write to artifact files **incrementally during execution**, so you can tail a running step's output in real time:

```bash
# In one terminal — run a long workflow
jaiph run ./flows/deploy.jh

# In another terminal — watch a step's output as it executes
tail -f .jaiph/runs/2026-03-22/14-30-00-deploy.jh/000003-deploy__run_migrations.out
```

Both `.out` (stdout) and `.err` (stderr) files grow as the step produces output. Steps that produce no output on a given stream have no corresponding artifact file. Empty files are cleaned up at step end.

### Run summary (`run_summary.jsonl`) {#run-summary-jsonl}

Each run directory also contains `run_summary.jsonl`: one JSON object per line, appended in execution order. It is the canonical append-only record of runtime events (lifecycle, logs, inbox flow, and step boundaries). Tooling can tail the file by byte offset and process new lines idempotently; parallel inbox dispatch may reorder some events relative to wall-clock time, but each line is written atomically under the same lock used for concurrent writers (see [Inbox — Lock behavior](inbox.md#lock-behavior)).

**Versioning.** Every object includes `event_version` (currently `1`). New fields may be added; consumers should tolerate unknown keys.

**Common fields.** All lines include `type`, `ts` (UTC timestamp), `run_id`, and `event_version`. Step-related types also carry `id`, `parent_id`, `seq`, and `depth` (matching the `__JAIPH_EVENT__` stream on stderr).

**Correlation rules:**

- **`run_id`:** same across all lines in a given run's file.
- **Workflow boundaries:** for each workflow name, `WORKFLOW_START` count equals `WORKFLOW_END` count. With `JAIPH_INBOX_PARALLEL=true`, lifecycle lines may interleave — use per-name counts, not a global stack.
- **Steps:** `STEP_START` and `STEP_END` share the same `id`. Use `parent_id`, `seq`, and `depth` to rebuild the tree.
- **Inbox:** one `INBOX_ENQUEUE` per `send` with a unique `inbox_seq` (zero-padded, e.g. `001`). Each routed target gets one `INBOX_DISPATCH_START` and one `INBOX_DISPATCH_COMPLETE` sharing the same `inbox_seq`, `channel`, `target`, and `sender`.
- **Ordering under parallel inbox:** lines are valid JSONL (one object per line, atomic append). Wall-clock `ts` order may diverge from append order between concurrent branches.

**Event taxonomy (schema `event_version` 1):**

| Field | `WORKFLOW_START` | `WORKFLOW_END` | `STEP_START` | `STEP_END` | `LOG` | `LOGERR` | `INBOX_ENQUEUE` | `INBOX_DISPATCH_START` | `INBOX_DISPATCH_COMPLETE` |
|-------|------------------|----------------|--------------|------------|-------|----------|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| `type` | required | required | required | required | required | required | required | required | required |
| `ts` | required | required | required | required | required | required | required | required | required |
| `run_id` | required | required | required | required | required | required | required | required | required |
| `event_version` | required (`1`) | required (`1`) | required (`1`) | required (`1`) | required (`1`) | required (`1`) | required (`1`) | required (`1`) | required (`1`) |
| `workflow` | required (name) | required (name) | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| `source` | required (basename or empty) | required (basename or empty) | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| `func`, `kind`, `name` | — | — | required | required | — | — | — | — | — |

| `params` | — | — | optional JSON array | optional JSON array | — | — | — | — | — |
| `dispatched`, `channel`, `sender` | — | — | optional (inbox dispatch) | optional (inbox dispatch) | — | — | — | — | — |
| `out_content`, `err_content` | — | — | — | optional on `STEP_END` | — | — | — | — | — |
| `message`, `depth` | — | — | — | — | required | required | — | — | — |
| `inbox_seq`, `channel`, `sender` | — | — | — | — | — | — | required | required | required |
| `payload_preview`, `payload_ref` | — | — | — | — | — | — | required | — | — |
| `target` | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | required | required |
| `status`, `elapsed_ms` (dispatch) | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | required (exit code and ms) |

`PROMPT_START` / `PROMPT_END` (not in the table): include `backend`, optional `model`, optional `model_reason`, optional `status`, optional `preview`, `depth`, and optional `step_id` / `step_name` tying the prompt to the enclosing step frame. `model` is the resolved model name (or `null` when the backend auto-selects). `model_reason` is one of `explicit`, `flags`, or `backend-default` — see [Configuration — Model resolution](configuration.md#model-resolution).

**Event semantics:**

- **`WORKFLOW_START` / `WORKFLOW_END`:** mark entry and exit of a workflow body. `workflow` is the declared name; `source` is the `.jh` basename.
- **`STEP_START` / `STEP_END`:** mirror stderr step events. `STEP_END` may include `out_content` / `err_content` (embedded artifact text, size-capped).
- **`LOG` / `LOGERR`:** emitted by `log` / `logerr` keywords. `depth` is the step-stack depth. `message` is the shell string before `echo -e` expansion.
- **`INBOX_ENQUEUE`:** recorded when a message is queued. `payload_preview` is UTF-8-safe JSON (up to 4096 bytes; truncated with `...`). `payload_ref` is `null` when the full body fits, otherwise a run-relative path.
- **`INBOX_DISPATCH_START` / `INBOX_DISPATCH_COMPLETE`:** wrap one invocation of a route target. `status` is exit code; `elapsed_ms` is wall time.

Together with step `.out` / `.err` files, `run_summary.jsonl` is enough to reconstruct the step tree, log timelines, inbox flow, and workflow boundaries. The `jaiph report` command exposes this data through a local HTTP API and browser UI (see [Reporting server](reporting.md)).

### Hooks

You can run custom commands at workflow/step lifecycle events via hooks. Config lives in `~/.jaiph/hooks.json` (global) and `<project>/.jaiph/hooks.json` (project-local); project-local overrides global per event. See [Hooks](hooks.md) for schema, events, payload, and examples.

## `jaiph test`

Run tests from `*.test.jh` files that contain `test "..." { ... }` blocks. Test files can import workflows and use `mock prompt` to simulate agent responses without calling the real backend.

The test runner uses the same Node workflow runtime as `jaiph run`. For each test file, the CLI compiles workspace `*.jh` modules (not `*.test.jh`) so imported modules have emitted scripts, then builds the runtime graph once and reuses it across all test blocks. Each block runs through the AST interpreter with mock support and assertion evaluation (`expectContain`, `expectEqual`, `expectNotContain`).

**Usage:**

- `jaiph test` — discover and run all `*.test.jh` under the workspace root. The workspace root is found by walking up from the current directory until a directory with `.jaiph` or `.git` is found; if neither exists, the current directory is used.
- `jaiph test <dir>` — run all `*.test.jh` files recursively under the given directory.
- `jaiph test <file.test.jh>` — run a single test file.

With no arguments, or with a directory that contains no test files, the command exits with status **1** and prints an error.

Passing a plain workflow file (e.g. `say_hello.jh`) is not supported; the test file imports the workflow and declares mocks. Extra arguments after the path are accepted but ignored. See [Testing](testing.md) for test block syntax and assertions.

**Examples:**

```bash
jaiph test
jaiph test ./e2e
jaiph test e2e/workflow_greeting.test.jh
jaiph test e2e/say_hello.test.jh
```

## `jaiph format`

Reformat `.jh` source files to a canonical style. The formatter parses each file into an AST and re-emits it with consistent whitespace and indentation. Formatting is idempotent — running it twice produces the same output. Comments and shebangs are preserved.

**Canonical definition order:** The formatter reorders top-level definitions to a fixed order: imports → config → channels → const declarations → rules → scripts → workflows → tests. Source files may declare these in any order; `jaiph format` normalizes them.

```bash
jaiph format [--check] [--indent <n>] <file.jh ...>
```

One or more `.jh` file paths are required. Non-`.jh` files are rejected. If a file cannot be parsed, the command exits immediately with status 1 and a parse error on stderr.

**Flags:**

- **`--indent <n>`** — spaces per indent level (default: `2`).
- **`--check`** — verify formatting without writing. Exits 0 when all files are already formatted; exits 1 when any file needs changes, printing the file name to stderr. No files are modified in check mode.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Rewrite files in place
jaiph format flow.jh utils.jh

# Check formatting in CI (non-zero exit on drift)
jaiph format --check src/**/*.jh

# Use 4-space indentation
jaiph format --indent 4 flow.jh
```

## `jaiph init`

Initialize Jaiph files in a workspace directory.

```bash
jaiph init [workspace-path]
```

Creates:

- `.jaiph/bootstrap.jh` — if it does not exist (otherwise left unchanged). Made executable.
- `.jaiph/jaiph-skill.md` — synced from the local Jaiph installation when the skill file is found; otherwise sync is skipped and a note is printed.

## `jaiph use`

Reinstall Jaiph globally with the selected channel or version.

```bash
jaiph use <version|nightly>
```

- `nightly` — installs from `main` branch.
- `<version>` — installs tag `v<version>`.

**Examples:**

```bash
jaiph use nightly
jaiph use 0.6.0
```

## `jaiph report` {#jaiph-report}

Serve a read-only reporting dashboard over run artifacts (`run_summary.jsonl` plus step `.out` / `.err` files). No database; the server indexes and tails summary files the runtime already writes.

```bash
jaiph report [start|stop|status] [--host <addr>] [--port <n>] [--poll-ms <n>] [--runs-dir <path>] [--workspace <path>] [--pid-file <path>]
```

**Commands:**

- **`start`** — start server in foreground and block until `Ctrl+C` (default when omitted).
- **`stop`** — stop the server process referenced by the PID file.
- **`status`** — check if the PID-referenced server is running.

**Options:**

- **`--host`** — bind address (default `127.0.0.1`).
- **`--port`** — listen port (default `8787`).
- **`--poll-ms`** — summary tail loop interval in milliseconds (default `500`, minimum `50`).
- **`--runs-dir`** — runs root directory. Uses `JAIPH_REPORT_RUNS_DIR` if set, otherwise `<workspace>/.jaiph/runs`.
- **`--workspace`** — project directory for resolving the default runs path (default: current working directory).
- **`--pid-file`** — PID file path for `status`/`stop` (default `<workspace>/.jaiph/report.pid`).

The server discovers runs under `<YYYY-MM-DD>/<time>-<source>/run_summary.jsonl`, caches directory scans, and tails each summary with byte-offset tracking so updates appear live without rereading whole files. HTTP API and UI details: [Reporting server](reporting.md).

## File extension

**`.jh`** is the file extension for Jaiph source files. Use it for entrypoints, imports, and all CLI commands (`run`, `test`). Import resolution appends `.jh` when the path omits the extension.

## Environment variables

### Runtime and config overrides

These variables apply to `jaiph run` and workflow execution. Variables marked **internal** are set automatically — do not set them manually.

**Internal variables:**

- `JAIPH_META_FILE` — path to the metadata file the CLI writes under the build output directory; the workflow runner reads it after exit. Set by the launcher on the child process; `resolveRuntimeEnv` removes any inherited value from the parent.
- `JAIPH_RUN_DIR`, `JAIPH_RUN_ID`, `JAIPH_RUN_SUMMARY_FILE` — set by `NodeWorkflowRuntime` to the run directory, stable run UUID, and `run_summary.jsonl` path.
- `JAIPH_SOURCE_FILE` — set automatically by the CLI to the entry file basename. Used to name run directories.

**Workspace and libraries:**

- `JAIPH_WORKSPACE` — workspace root, set by the CLI. Detected by walking up from the entry `.jh` file's directory until `.jaiph` or `.git` is found. Guards in `detectWorkspaceRoot` skip misleading markers under shared system temp directories (`/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, macOS `/var/folders/.../T/...`) and nested `.jaiph/tmp` trees. In Docker sandbox mode the runtime remaps it inside the container (see [Sandboxing](sandboxing.md)).
- `JAIPH_LIB` — directory for project-local shared bash libraries (conventionally `<workspace>/.jaiph/lib`). The runtime sets this to `${JAIPH_WORKSPACE:-.}/.jaiph/lib` for `script` steps. Override when libraries live elsewhere. See [Grammar](grammar.md#step-output-contract).
- `JAIPH_RUNS_DIR` — root directory for run logs (default: `.jaiph/runs` under workspace).

**Agent and prompt configuration:**

- `JAIPH_AGENT_BACKEND` — prompt backend: `cursor` (default), `claude`, or `codex`. Overrides in-file `agent.backend`. When set to `claude`, the Anthropic Claude CLI must be on PATH. When set to `codex`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` must be set. See [Configuration](configuration.md).
- `JAIPH_AGENT_MODEL` — default model for `prompt` steps (overrides in-file `agent.default_model`).
- `JAIPH_AGENT_COMMAND` — command for the Cursor backend (e.g. `cursor-agent`; overrides in-file `agent.command`).
- `JAIPH_AGENT_TRUSTED_WORKSPACE` — trusted workspace directory for Cursor backend `--trust`. Defaults to project root.
- `JAIPH_AGENT_CURSOR_FLAGS` — extra flags for Cursor backend (string, split on whitespace).
- `JAIPH_AGENT_CLAUDE_FLAGS` — extra flags for Claude backend (string, split on whitespace).
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — API key for the codex backend. Required when `agent.backend` is `"codex"`.
- `JAIPH_CODEX_API_URL` — endpoint URL for the codex backend (default: `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`). Use this to point at a compatible proxy or self-hosted endpoint.

**Execution behavior:**

- `JAIPH_DEBUG` — set to `true` for debug tracing.
- `JAIPH_ENSURE_MAX_RETRIES` — maximum attempt rounds for `ensure ... recover` (default: **3**). When all rounds fail, the workflow exits with status 1.
- `JAIPH_INBOX_PARALLEL` — set to `true` for parallel dispatch of inbox route targets (overrides in-file `run.inbox_parallel`). See [Inbox](inbox.md).
- `NO_COLOR` — disables colored output.

**Non-TTY heartbeat:**

- `JAIPH_NON_TTY_HEARTBEAT_FIRST_SEC` — seconds before the first heartbeat (default: `60`).
- `JAIPH_NON_TTY_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` — minimum milliseconds between subsequent heartbeats (default: `30000`; minimum `250`).

**Docker sandbox:**

- `JAIPH_DOCKER_ENABLED` — set to `true` to enable Docker sandbox (overrides in-file `runtime.docker_enabled`).
- `JAIPH_DOCKER_IMAGE` — Docker image for sandbox (overrides in-file `runtime.docker_image`).
- `JAIPH_DOCKER_NETWORK` — Docker network mode (overrides in-file `runtime.docker_network`).
- `JAIPH_DOCKER_TIMEOUT` — execution timeout in seconds (overrides in-file `runtime.docker_timeout`).

For `JAIPH_DOCKER_*` defaults, image selection, mounts, and container behavior, see [Sandboxing](sandboxing.md).

### `jaiph report`

- `JAIPH_REPORT_HOST` — bind address (default `127.0.0.1`).
- `JAIPH_REPORT_PORT` — port (default `8787`).
- `JAIPH_REPORT_POLL_MS` — summary tail loop interval in ms (default `500`, minimum `50`).
- `JAIPH_REPORT_RUNS_DIR` — runs root (default `<cwd>/.jaiph/runs` unless `--runs-dir` / `--workspace` override).
- `JAIPH_REPORT_PID_FILE` — PID file for `status`/`stop` (default `<workspace>/.jaiph/report.pid`).

### Install and `jaiph use`

- `JAIPH_REPO_URL` — Git repo URL or local path for install script.
- `JAIPH_REPO_REF` — ref used when installing; `jaiph use <version>` sets this to `v<version>` or `main` for nightly.
- `JAIPH_BIN_DIR` — target bin directory (default: `$HOME/.local/bin`).
- `JAIPH_LIB_DIR` — target lib directory (default: `$JAIPH_BIN_DIR/.jaiph`).
- `JAIPH_INSTALL_COMMAND` — command run by `jaiph use` to reinstall (default: `curl -fsSL https://jaiph.org/install | bash`).

### `jaiph init`

- `JAIPH_SKILL_PATH` — path to the skill file copied to `.jaiph/jaiph-skill.md` when syncing from the local installation.
