# Jaiph Docs

This directory contains a compact reference for the current Jaiph language.

- `getting-started.md` - install, PATH setup, run/build commands
- `intro.md` - what Jaiph is and when to use it
- `philosophy.md` - design rules and trade-offs
- `examples.md` - practical source + transpiled shape
- `grammar.md` - formal grammar and validation rules
- `stdlib.md` - runtime helper functions available in generated Bash

If a behavior in code and docs ever differ, treat the compiler as source of truth and update docs.
