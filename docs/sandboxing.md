# Sandboxing

## Overview

Workflow orchestration often mixes shell scripts, agent calls, and file or inbox I/O. Without discipline, that mix encourages hidden dependencies on mutable global state and tools with more host access than you meant to grant. **Sandboxing** in Jaiph addresses that in two **independent** ways:

1. **Rules (language + convention)** — The grammar restricts what can appear in a **rule** so bodies stay small and reviewable. That is a *static* boundary, not an OS-level sandbox.
2. **Docker (optional)** — You can run the **entire** `jaiph run` workflow inside a container so filesystem and process isolation match Docker’s model. This is opt-in via `runtime.*` config and env overrides.

The allowed-step set for **rule** bodies applies whenever you define a rule; Docker isolation applies only when you enable it. Execution details below match the **Node workflow runtime** in [Architecture](../ARCHITECTURE.md): `jaiph run` uses `NodeWorkflowRuntime` and streams `__JAIPH_EVENT__` on stderr for both local and Docker launches. [Hooks](hooks.md) still run on the **host** CLI; they consume the same event stream from the runner (including when the runner is inside a container).

For general `config` syntax, allowed keys, and precedence, see [Configuration](configuration.md). This page focuses on rules-as-discipline and Docker; the [Grammar](grammar.md) page has the full orchestration vs script matrix.

## Rules: checks, not mutating work

**Rules** are for structured validation. Only a subset of step types is allowed: `ensure` (other **rules**), `run` (**scripts** only — not workflows), `const` (script/rule captures or bash RHS — not `prompt`), braced `if` with `ensure`/`run` conditions, `fail`, `log` / `logerr`, and `return`. There is no raw shell, `prompt`, `send` / `route` / `wait`, `run async`, or `ensure … recover` inside rule bodies. See [Grammar — High-level concepts](grammar.md#high-level-concepts) for the authoritative list.

Under **`jaiph run`**, the runtime implements rules by walking the AST **in-process** in Node (`NodeWorkflowRuntime.executeRule` → `executeSteps`). There is **no** extra per-rule OS sandbox: no Linux mount namespace, no automatic read-only filesystem for the rule body.

When a rule runs a **script** step (`run some_script()`), that script is executed as a **normal managed subprocess** (same `spawn`-based path as scripts invoked from workflows): it uses the workspace environment and can read or write any path the process user can access. Design rules accordingly: treat rules as non-mutating checks; perform intentional filesystem changes in **workflows**, not in rules.

Older Bash-oriented materials and compiler golden fixtures referred to Linux **`unshare`** + passwordless **`sudo`** to remount the filesystem read-only around rule bodies. That does **not** apply to the current Node orchestration path for `jaiph run`.

**`jaiph test`** executes tests in-process with `NodeTestRunner`; it does not use Docker or a separate rule sandbox.

## Docker container isolation (optional)

> **Beta.** Docker sandboxing is functional but still under active development. Expect rough edges, breaking changes, and incomplete platform coverage. Feedback is welcome at <https://github.com/jaiphlang/jaiph/issues>.

Docker applies to **`jaiph run` only** (not `jaiph test`). When enabled, the **entire** workflow—including every rule and script step—runs inside one container using the same **Node workflow runtime** as local execution: `node /jaiph/generated/src/runtime/kernel/node-workflow-runner.js` with `.jh` sources and `JAIPH_SCRIPTS` on the workspace mount. Container boundaries apply to the whole run; they do not add a separate per-rule isolation mechanism beyond that.

### Where Docker settings may live

`runtime.*` keys belong only in a **module-level** `config { ... }` block (top of the `.jh` file). They are **not** allowed inside a **workflow-level** `config` block (workflow blocks may only override `agent.*` and `run.*`). Putting `runtime.*` in a workflow-level block is a parse error.

### Enabling Docker sandbox

Docker sandboxing is **opt-in**. Set `runtime.docker_enabled = true` in module-level config, or control enablement with `JAIPH_DOCKER_ENABLED`:

```jh
config {
  runtime.docker_enabled = true
}
```

If `JAIPH_DOCKER_ENABLED` is **set** in the environment, it overrides in-file `runtime.docker_enabled`: only the literal string `true` turns Docker on; `false` or any other value turns it off. If `JAIPH_DOCKER_ENABLED` is **unset**, the in-file value (default `false`) applies.

When Docker is enabled but the `docker` binary is not usable (`docker info` fails), the run fails with `E_DOCKER_NOT_FOUND` (no silent fallback).

### Configuration keys

All Docker-related keys live under `runtime.*` in module-level config:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `runtime.docker_enabled` | boolean | `false` | Enable Docker sandbox for the run. |
| `runtime.docker_image` | string | `"node:20-bookworm"` | Container image to use (includes Node for the workflow kernel). |
| `runtime.docker_network` | string | `"default"` | Docker network mode. |
| `runtime.docker_timeout` | integer | `300` | Maximum execution time in seconds (`0` disables the timeout timer). |
| `runtime.workspace` | string array | `[".:/jaiph/workspace:rw"]` | Mount specifications. |

Each key enforces its expected type at parse time. Unknown config keys anywhere in `config` produce `E_PARSE` (message lists allowed keys).

#### Environment variable overrides

Following the `JAIPH_*` convention: `JAIPH_DOCKER_ENABLED`, `JAIPH_DOCKER_IMAGE`, `JAIPH_DOCKER_NETWORK`, `JAIPH_DOCKER_TIMEOUT`. Workspace mounts are **not** overridable via env.

Precedence: `JAIPH_DOCKER_*` environment variables → in-file config → defaults.

If `JAIPH_DOCKER_TIMEOUT` is set but not a valid integer, the default timeout (`300`) is used.

### Mount parsing rules

Mount strings in `runtime.workspace` use these forms:

- **Full form** (3 segments): `"host_path:container_path:mode"` — mounts `host_path` at `container_path` with mode `ro` or `rw`.
- **Shorthand** (2 segments): `"host_path:mode"` — mounts at `/jaiph/workspace/<host_path>` (relative segment; may contain further path components) with the given mode.
- **1 segment** — invalid (`E_PARSE` from mount parsing when Docker config is resolved).
- **More than 3 segments** (e.g. too many `:` in a single spec) — invalid (`E_PARSE`); use the 3-segment form if you need an explicit container path.
- Mode must be `ro` or `rw` — otherwise `E_PARSE`.
- Exactly one mount must target `/jaiph/workspace` — `E_VALIDATE` if zero or more than one. Omitting `runtime.workspace` uses the default `[".:/jaiph/workspace:rw"]`, which satisfies this.

Host paths are resolved relative to the workspace root when building `docker run` `-v` arguments.

### Workspace structure inside the container

```
/jaiph/
  generated/          # mounted read-only
    scripts/          # extracted per-step script executables
    src/              # compiled JS source tree (parser, types, transpile, runtime kernel)
      runtime/
        kernel/
          node-workflow-runner.js
          emit.js, inbox.js, prompt.js, run-step-exec.js, …
  workspace/          # the mount targeting /jaiph/workspace (read-write root)
    *.jh              # source files (read by the runner at startup)
    .jaiph/
      runs/
        <YYYY-MM-DD>/
          <HH-MM-SS>-<source-file>/
            000001-<module>__<step>.out
            000002-<module>__<step>.out
            ...
```

- **`/jaiph/generated/`** — Contains the compiled JS source tree (`src/`) and extracted script files (`scripts/`). The container entry is `node /jaiph/generated/src/runtime/kernel/node-workflow-runner.js`, which builds the runtime graph from `.jh` sources in the workspace mount and executes through `NodeWorkflowRuntime` — the same path as local `jaiph run`. Everything under `generated/` is mounted read-only. `JAIPH_SCRIPTS` points to `/jaiph/generated/scripts`.
- **Working directory** — `/jaiph/workspace`.
- **What is shipped** — The compiled JS tree (no TypeScript or `node_modules` in the generated mount) and per-step script executables. No workflow-level `.sh` or `jaiph_stdlib.sh` is required. `.jh` source files are read from the workspace mount.

The CLI mounts the host **directory** that contains the run meta file read-write at **`/jaiph/meta`** in the container and sets **`JAIPH_META_FILE`** to **`/jaiph/meta/<meta-basename>`**. The runner writes status and run-directory paths there; the host CLI reads the same file after the container exits (host temp paths are not reused as in-container paths).

### Docker behavior

- `docker run --rm` with UID/GID mapping (`--user $(id -u):$(id -g)`) on Linux when `id` succeeds; other platforms omit `--user` if mapping is not applied.
- **Structured events** — The `node-workflow-runner` process inside the container writes `__JAIPH_EVENT__` JSON to **stderr only**, the same single event channel used for local runs. The CLI listens on stderr exclusively; stdout carries only plain script output. This is the same contract for all execution modes — the CLI does not parse stdout for events in any mode.
- **`STEP_END` and step logs** — The runtime embeds `out_content` in every `STEP_END` event and `err_content` when the step failed, so consumers do not need host paths to step `.out`/`.err` files (critical in Docker). Payloads are JSON-escaped by the JS emit kernel per RFC 8259 for control characters through `U+001F` plus `\` and `"`. Embedded content is capped at 1 MiB; larger output is truncated with a `[truncated]` marker while full logs remain in `out_file` / `err_file` under the run directory. After a run, failure summaries prefer embedded fields when present and may fall back to reading files for older summaries that predate embedding.
- Docker missing — `E_DOCKER_NOT_FOUND` (no silent fallback).
- Image — If not present locally, `docker pull` is attempted; pull failure → `E_DOCKER_PULL`.
- Timeout — When `runtime.docker_timeout` is greater than zero, overrun kills the container; the CLI may append `E_TIMEOUT container execution exceeded timeout` to captured stderr when the run fails after a timeout.
- Network — `"default"` omits `--network` (Docker’s default bridge). `"none"` passes `--network none`. Any other value is passed through to `docker run --network`.

### Dockerfile-based image detection

The runtime treats the image as **explicitly configured** if **either** `runtime.docker_image` appears in the file (any value) **or** `JAIPH_DOCKER_IMAGE` is set in the environment. In that case `.jaiph/Dockerfile` is **not** consulted.

When the image is **not** explicit (no in-file `runtime.docker_image` and no `JAIPH_DOCKER_IMAGE`):

1. If `.jaiph/Dockerfile` exists in the workspace root, the runtime runs `docker build`, tags the result `jaiph-runtime:latest`, and uses that image.
2. Otherwise it uses the configured image name (default `node:20-bookworm`), pulling if needed.

Build failure → `E_DOCKER_BUILD`.

The repository’s example `.jaiph/Dockerfile` includes:

- **Base image**: `ubuntu:latest`
- **Node.js** — latest LTS from NodeSource (required: the container runs `node-workflow-runner`)
- **Claude Code CLI** — `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- **cursor-agent** — installed via Cursor’s distribution, normalized to `/usr/local/bin/cursor-agent` when possible
- **Utilities** — `bash`, `curl`, `git`, `ca-certificates`, `gnupg`

### Agent environment variable forwarding

Besides variables forwarded as part of the normal `JAIPH_*` pass-through (except driver-managed keys like `JAIPH_SCRIPTS` and `JAIPH_META_FILE`), the following prefixes are forwarded for agent authentication and tooling:

- `CURSOR_*`
- `ANTHROPIC_*`
- `CLAUDE_*`

### Docker path remapping

When Docker mode is enabled, the CLI remaps workspace-related environment variables before passing them into the container so run artifacts land under the workspace mount.

- `JAIPH_WORKSPACE` is always `/jaiph/workspace` inside the container.
- `JAIPH_RUNS_DIR`:
  - **Relative** (e.g. `custom_runs`) — unchanged; resolved under `/jaiph/workspace`, which maps back to the host via the workspace mount.
  - **Absolute path inside the host workspace** — rewritten to the equivalent path under `/jaiph/workspace`.
  - **Absolute path outside the workspace** — `E_DOCKER_RUNS_DIR`; use a relative path or a directory inside the workspace.

Configure `JAIPH_RUNS_DIR` the same way as for a non-Docker run; remapping is automatic.

### Example

Minimal workflow with Docker sandbox enabled (adds an extra read-only mount of a `config` directory next to the workflow via the shorthand form):

```jh
config {
  runtime.docker_enabled = true
  runtime.docker_timeout = 600
  runtime.workspace = [
    ".:/jaiph/workspace:rw",
    "config:ro"
  ]
}

workflow default {
  log "Running inside Docker"
}
```
