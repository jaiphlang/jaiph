# Jaiph Improvement Queue (Hard Rewrite Track)

This file is a generated view. Do not edit it. Do not agent-edit it.
Use the product-owner defs (`propose_task`, `update_task`, `pick_task`,
`report_completed_task`, `task_details`) via `jaiph serve` / MCP.

Process rules:

1. `pick_task` prefers the first `#dev-ready` task that is not `#in-progress`.
   The product owner may claim a later available task instead.
2. The first `##` section is the preferred next task in this view.
3. `#dev-ready` means ready to implement. `#in-progress` means claimed by `pick_task`.
4. Runtime mutations go through the product-owner defs only.
5. Every task must be standalone: no hidden assumptions, no "read prior task".
6. Hard rewrite semantics: breaking changes are allowed unless a task says otherwise.
7. Acceptance criteria are non-negotiable. A task is not done until every
   acceptance bullet is verified by a test that fails when the contract is violated.
