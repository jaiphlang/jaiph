# Jaiph Improvement Queue (Hard Rewrite Track)

This file is a generated view. Do not edit it. Do not agent-edit it.
Use the product-owner defs (`propose_task`, `update_task`, `pick_task`,
`report_completed_task`, `task_details`) via `jaiph serve` / MCP.

Process rules:

1. `pick_task` prefers the first `#dev-ready` task that is not `#in-progress`.
   The product owner may claim a later available task instead.
2. The first `##` section is the preferred next task in this view.
3. `#dev-ready` means ready to implement. `#in-progress` means claimed by `pick_task`.
4. Runtime mutations go through the product-owner defs only.
5. Every task must be standalone: no hidden assumptions, no "read prior task".
6. Hard rewrite semantics: breaking changes are allowed unless a task says otherwise.
7. Acceptance criteria are non-negotiable. A task is not done until every
   acceptance bullet is verified by a test that fails when the contract is violated.

## Dispatch def-body statements from tokens #dev-ready

Prerequisite: `src/parse/lexer.ts` exports `tokenize()` (line/column tokens for strings, `"""` blocks, one-line and fenced scripts with interpreter tags, idents, punctuation). If it does not exist, this task is blocked.

`src/parse/workflow-brace.ts` (about 1,400 lines) parses def bodies line by line. The `STATEMENT` table dispatches on `c.inner.startsWith("<keyword> ")`, and fenced / `"""` blocks are parsed by copying the whole `lines` array (`[...lines]`) and splicing one line, once per block, in `workflow-brace.ts`, `const-rhs.ts`, `send-rhs.ts`, `prompt.ts`, `inline-script.ts`, and `triple-quote.ts`. It is exempt from the ESLint `max-lines` and `import/max-dependencies` caps in `eslint.config.mjs`.

### Required

- Def-body statements are parsed from a token cursor. `STATEMENT` dispatches on the first token's kind and text, not on string prefixes.
- No `[...lines]` copies remain in these files; block parsers advance the cursor.
- Split `workflow-brace.ts` into cohesive modules under the ESLint caps without an import cycle (`npm run arch:check` enforces `no-circular`), and delete its override in `eslint.config.mjs`.
- The AST and its trivia are unchanged: same `StepDef` shapes, same `loc` values, same error codes and messages and columns.

### Acceptance

- Golden ASTs, `test-fixtures/compiler-txtar/parse-errors-snapshot.json` (no snapshot update needed), compiler fixtures, and `integration/format-roundtrip.test.ts` are unchanged.
- `npm test`, `npm run lint` (with the override removed), `npm run arch:check`, and `bash e2e/test_all.sh` pass.

## Parse top-level declarations from tokens

Prerequisite: `src/parse/lexer.ts` exports `tokenize()` (line/column tokens for strings, `"""` blocks, one-line and fenced scripts with interpreter tags, idents, punctuation). If it does not exist, this task is blocked.

Top-level declarations are parsed line by line: `src/parse/parse-module.ts` dispatches each line, and `scripts.ts`, `env.ts`, `imports.ts`, `channels.ts`, `metadata.ts` (`config { … }`), `prompt-def.ts`, and `tests.ts` (`*.test.jh` blocks) each re-scan raw text with their own regexes.

### Required

- Every top-level declaration is parsed from a token cursor: `import`, `import script`, `channel` and routes, `config { … }`, `const`, `script` (with `use` clause and interpreter tag), `prompt` definitions, `def` / `export def` headers, and `test "…" { … }` blocks with their DSL statements.
- Config values keep their rules: `\"` is the only escape; `\n`, `\t`, `\\` are `E_PARSE` with the existing migration message (`rejectRemovedEscapes` in `src/parse/core.ts`).
- The AST and trivia are unchanged, including `ConfigBodyPart.bareSource` and `EnvDeclDef.tripleQuoted`.

### Acceptance

- Golden ASTs, `test-fixtures/compiler-txtar/parse-errors-snapshot.json` (no snapshot update needed), compiler fixtures, and `integration/format-roundtrip.test.ts` are unchanged.
- `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run arch:check`, and `bash e2e/test_all.sh` pass.

## Remove the line-based parser helpers

Prerequisite: def bodies, top-level declarations, strings, and call arguments are all parsed from `tokenize()` in `src/parse/lexer.ts`. If any parser module still scans raw lines, this task is blocked.

### Required

- Delete every helper that only served line-based parsing: string-prefix detectors (`startsInlineScript`, `startsTaggedScriptFence`, `splitScriptLangPrefix`, `looksLikeInlineScriptCall` if still present), quote scanners (`indexOfClosingDoubleQuote`, `hasUnescapedClosingQuote`), `src/parse/statement-split.ts` if unused, and anything `ts-prune`-style dead after the migration. Keep functions the runtime or validator still import through `src/parser.ts`.
- Update `docs/architecture.md` (parser section) to describe the tokenizer and the cursor-based parsers, and remove references to deleted helpers. `docs/agent-analyzability.md` parse row stays accurate.

### Acceptance

- No file under `src/parse/` reads `.split("\n")` lines for parsing except `tokenize()`.
- Golden ASTs, compiler fixtures, and `integration/format-roundtrip.test.ts` are unchanged.
- `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run arch:check`, and `bash e2e/test_all.sh` pass. Add a CHANGELOG entry under Unreleased.
