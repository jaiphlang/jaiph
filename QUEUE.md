# Jaiph Improvement Queue (Hard Rewrite Track)

This file is a generated view. Do not edit it. Do not agent-edit it.
Use the product-owner defs (`propose_task`, `update_task`, `pick_task`,
`report_completed_task`, `task_details`) via `jaiph serve` / MCP.

Process rules:

1. `pick_task` prefers the first `#dev-ready` task that is not `#in-progress`.
   The product owner may claim a later available task instead.
2. The first `##` section is the preferred next task in this view.
3. `#dev-ready` means ready to implement. `#in-progress` means claimed by `pick_task`.
4. Runtime mutations go through the product-owner defs only.
5. Every task must be standalone: no hidden assumptions, no "read prior task".
6. Hard rewrite semantics: breaking changes are allowed unless a task says otherwise.
7. Acceptance criteria are non-negotiable. A task is not done until every
   acceptance bullet is verified by a test that fails when the contract is violated.

## Remove the line-based parser helpers

Prerequisite: def bodies, top-level declarations, strings, and call arguments are all parsed from `tokenize()` in `src/parse/lexer.ts`. If any parser module still scans raw lines, this task is blocked.

### Required

- Delete every helper that only served line-based parsing: string-prefix detectors (`startsInlineScript`, `startsTaggedScriptFence`, `splitScriptLangPrefix`, `looksLikeInlineScriptCall` if still present), quote scanners (`indexOfClosingDoubleQuote`, `hasUnescapedClosingQuote`), `src/parse/statement-split.ts` if unused, and anything `ts-prune`-style dead after the migration. Keep functions the runtime or validator still import through `src/parser.ts`.
- Update `docs/architecture.md` (parser section) to describe the tokenizer and the cursor-based parsers, and remove references to deleted helpers. `docs/agent-analyzability.md` parse row stays accurate.

### Acceptance

- No file under `src/parse/` reads `.split("\n")` lines for parsing except `tokenize()`.
- Golden ASTs, compiler fixtures, and `integration/format-roundtrip.test.ts` are unchanged.
- `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run arch:check`, and `bash e2e/test_all.sh` pass. Add a CHANGELOG entry under Unreleased.
